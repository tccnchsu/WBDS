Wristband Dataset (WBDS) for Construction Worker Individual Risk Detection Research


1. Dataset Overview
This project develops the Wristband Dataset (WBDS), a synthetic dataset tailored for research on individual risk detection among construction workers. The dataset was generated through two key steps to ensure real-world relevance:
•	Sampling from statistical distributions derived from preliminary field observations, which define realistic ranges for core metrics (e.g., heart rate, peripheral oxygen saturation [SpO₂], body temperature, and step counts).
•	Incorporating stochastic perturbations to replicate both intra-individual variability (e.g., a single worker’s fluctuating heart rate throughout a shift) and inter-individual differences (e.g., varying step counts across workers with different job roles).
2. Dataset Access
To access WBDS, please follow these steps:
1.	Complete the Dataset License Agreement (provided separately or via the project’s official channel).
2.	Email the signed agreement to 61201903@fjut.edu.cn with the subject line: “Wristband Dataset (WBDS) for Construction Worker Individual Risk Detection Research”.
3.	Upon verification of the agreement, you will receive access to the dataset download URL.
3. Citation Requirement
Whenever the WBDS dataset is used in any paper, publication, report, or research output, the following associated publication must be cited to acknowledge the dataset’s development and ensure academic attribution:
